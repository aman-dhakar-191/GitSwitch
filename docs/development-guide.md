## üéØ How to Use Each Stage File

### Stage 1: Foundation MVP (`stage-1-mvp.md`)
**When to use:** Starting development, building core functionality
**Focus:** Get basic CLI and desktop app working
**Team size:** 1-2 developers
**AI prompting:** Use for implementing basic features, git integration, and core UI

**Example AI prompts:**
```
"Using the Stage 1 MVP specifications, help me implement the GitManager class for reading and writing git configs"

"Based on the Stage 1 UI specifications, create a React component for the main project context view"

"Following the Stage 1 data models, help me set up the local storage system for accounts and projects"
```

### Stage 2: Enhanced Features (`stage-2-enhanced.md`)
**When to use:** After Stage 1 is complete and stable
**Focus:** Smart automation, better UX, system integration
**Team size:** 2-3 developers
**AI prompting:** Use for implementing smart detection, UI improvements, and automation

**Example AI prompts:**
```
"Based on the Stage 2 smart detection engine specs, help me implement the URL pattern matching algorithm"

"Following the Stage 2 git hook integration requirements, help me implement the pre-commit validation system"
```

### Stage 3: Advanced Features (`stage-3-advanced.md`)
**When to use:** After Stage 2 features are working well
**Focus:** Enterprise features, plugins, advanced integrations
**Team size:** 2-4 developers

## üí° AI-Assisted Development Tips

### Effective Prompting Strategies

#### 1. Context-Rich Prompts
Always include the relevant stage file context:
```
"I'm working on Stage 2 of GitSwitch. Based on the smart detection engine specifications in the stage-2-enhanced.md file, help me implement..."
```

#### 2. Reference Specific Sections
Point to specific parts of the specs:
```
"Looking at the Stage 1 technical requirements for the GitManager class, I need help implementing the getCurrentConfig method that..."
```

#### 3. Ask for Complete Implementation
Request full implementations with error handling:
```
"Based on the Stage 1 data models, create a complete TypeScript implementation of the Account management system including validation, storage, and error handling"
```

#### 4. Request Testing Code
Always ask for comprehensive testing:
```
"Based on the Stage 1 testing strategy, create unit tests for the git config switching functionality"
```

### Code Quality Prompts
```
"Review this implementation against the Stage [X] requirements and suggest improvements for performance, security, and maintainability"

"Based on the Stage [X] technical architecture, help me refactor this code to follow the specified patterns"

"Using the Stage [X] error handling guidelines, add proper error management to this implementation"
```

## üèó Development Workflow

### Recommended Development Approach

#### Week-by-Week Development
**Stage 1 (Weeks 1-4):**
- Week 1: Project setup, CLI foundation
- Week 2: Git integration, core logic
- Week 3: Desktop app, basic UI
- Week 4: Polish, testing, bug fixes

**Stage 2 (Weeks 5-8):**
- Week 5: Smart detection engine
- Week 6: Enhanced UI, dashboard
- Week 7: System integration, tray
- Week 8: Git hooks, automation

**Stage 3 (Weeks 9-12):**
- Week 9: Enterprise features, team sync
- Week 10: IDE integrations, plugins
- Week 11: Security, compliance
- Week 12: Polish, enterprise deployment

### Quality Gates Between Stages
Each stage must meet specific quality criteria before proceeding:

**Stage 1 Quality Gate:**
- All core functionality works without crashes
- Data integrity maintained across restarts
- Basic security measures implemented
- User feedback collected and positive

**Stage 2 Quality Gate:**
- Smart features work accurately
- Performance meets benchmarks
- User experience is intuitive
- System integration is stable

**Stage 3 Quality Gate:**
- Enterprise security requirements met
- Scalability tested and verified
- Plugin system is stable
- Ready for market launch

I'm starting development of GitSwitch, a git identity management tool. I have the complete specifications divided into 3 stages. I want to begin with Stage 1 (Foundation MVP). Based on the Stage 1 specifications, help me:

1. Set up the initial project structure for both CLI and desktop app
2. Configure the development environment with TypeScript, Electron, and React
3. Create the basic package.json files and build configuration
4. Implement the initial CLI tool that can detect the current directory and launch the Electron app

Please provide step-by-step instructions and code examples.
