# GitSwitch Tray Icon Placeholder
# In production, this would be a 16x16 or 32x32 PNG icon
# For now, we'll use a simple text-based representation
# The actual icon should be created using proper image editing tools

# Icon should represent:
# - Git branching/switching concept
# - Simple and recognizable at small sizes
# - Platform-appropriate styling (template image on macOS)
